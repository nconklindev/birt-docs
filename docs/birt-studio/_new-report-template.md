If you are in need of a new custom report and would like to see if Support can build it for you, use this template.

Please note that not every report request will be possible within BIRT Studio. Support will do the best they can

**Description:** What is the report supposed to do? A detailed description here can often make up for not knowing
exactly what columns you need included.

**Desired Columns**: What columns from the [Data Dictionary](/docs/data-dictionary/getting-started) do you need? If you
do not know, a bulleted list or description of the data that needs to be returned helps.

**Additional Information**: Anything else you'd like to include that will help Support work with you on this report.
