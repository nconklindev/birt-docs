# Getting Started

## About BIRT Studio

BIRT Studio is a web-based report design tool used in the Pro WFM application. It allows users to create
professional-looking reports quickly and easily without detailed understanding of database architecture or report design
techniques. All that's needed is a basic understanding of the data that is available for use and the ability to drag and
drop fields onto a report canvas.

## Who This Guide is For

The guide on this page is meant to introduce someone unfamiliar with creating a custom report in BIRT Studio to the
basic concepts and steps involved in creating a report. It is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to all of the
features and functionality of BIRT Studio. For more information on how to do specific things within BIRT Studio that may
be considered more advanced, please see the other articles in the sidebar to the left. If you're viewing this on mobile,
use the menu icon in the top left of your screen.

## When to Use Reports

Reports are a great way to get data out of Pro WFM. They are easy to create and most dataviews can be turned into
reports! However, there are some limitations to dataviews that reports do not have. For example, dataviews cannot be
scheduled to run automatically. They also cannot be exported to PDF or Excel. Reports can do all of these things and
more. While reports take a few more steps to get set up, they can be much more powerful than dataviews.

## Creating Report Data Objects

To get started creating a Report Data Object (RDO), from the home menu of Pro WFM, open the <Menu className="icon" />
menu and navigate to **Application Setup > Common Setup > Report Data Object Management**. This will open the Report
Data Object Management screen.

Once on this page, click the <Plus className="icon" /> **Add** button. This will open a dropdown menu. From the dropdown
menu, select the type of RDO you want to create. The options are **Employee**, **Business Structure View**, **Employee -
Time Series**, and **Business Structure - Time Series**. **Work Unit View** and **Work Unit - Time Series** may be
available if Healthcare Analytics is enabled. Most reports will use the **Employee** or **Business Structure View**
option.

Once on this page, enter a **Report Data Object Key**. This is the name of the RDO and will be used to identify it when
adding to any reports. A **Description** is optional. The **TimeFrame** of the RDO is required but the default of
_Selected Time Period_ is perfect for most reports.

See our doc about the [Relative Time Period](/docs/birt-studio/advanced/relative-time-period-reports) to learn more
about how to create reports that use this feature.

:::tip

It is best practice to use the same name for the RDO as the report you are creating. This will make it easier to find
the RDO when adding it to the report. Standard naming conventions for RDOs include <strong>ReportName_DO</strong> or
<strong>ReportName_version</strong> where <em>version</em> is the version number of the report if making multiple
iterations.

:::

:::info The Column Relationship Rules checkbox may not be visible in your environment. If it is not, it needs to be
enabled through a Feature Switch. Enable the Feature Switch from <strong>Application Setup &gt System Configuration &gt
Feature Switch</strong>. The Feature Switch is called <em>Ability to Disable Column Relationship Rules</em>.

:::

### Adding Columns to RDO

To add columns to an RDO, click the <Plus className="icon" /> **Add** button. This will open the **Select Column**
screen. From the **Select Column** screen, select the columns you want to add to the RDO and click the **Add Column**
button. For each column, you have the option of changing the default _Label_. Clicking the **Add Column** button will
add the columns to the RDO and close the **Select Column** screen. Once you are done, click the **Save** button to save
the RDO.

To read more about relationship rules, how to use them effectively and how they affect your report, see the
[Relationship Rules](/docs/data-dictionary/getting-started#understanding-the-column-relationship-rules) section of the
Getting Started guide.

## Creating Report Design

Once your RDO is created, you can create a report design. To do this, open the <Menu className="icon" /> menu and
navigate to **Application Setup > Common Setup > Unpublished Reports**. This will open the Unpublished Reports page.
Once on this page, click the <Plus className="icon" /> **Create** button. This will open BIRT Studio. If the button says
**Create Design**, click it and select **Common Report** from the dropdown menu.

The above page will open. This is the BIRT Studio application. From here, you can create your report design. This is
where you will add your columns, filters, and other report elements.

### Adding RDO to Report Design

With BIRT Studio open, the next step is adding your RDO to the report design. From the top menu, select **Data** >
**Manage Data**. This opens the **Manage Data** window to select the RDO you want to use. In the area labeled _Available
Data_, select the RDO you want to use and click the <ChevronRight className="icon" /> icon in the middle between the two
areas. This will move the RDO to the _Selected Data_ area. Click **OK** to close the **Manage Data** window.

:::warning

Do not delete the Hyperfind_DO during this step or when in the **Manage Data** window. This is the RDO that is used to
generate the available Hyperfinds in the application. If this Data Object is deleted, there will no longer be a
Hyperfind dropdown when previewing the report and you will need to know the Hyperfind ID to run the report.

:::

:::info

The RDOs available will only be those that were created as Custom RDOs. Standard and Read-Only RDOs do not appear in
this window. If you need to use a Standard RDO, you will need to go through the process to duplicate a Standard report
and its RDO. See the [Modifying Standard Reports](/docs/birt-studio/customizing-reports/modifying-standard-reports)
article for more information.

:::

Once the RDO has been added to the report, the <Save className="icon" /> **Save** button will become active. It is
optional to save the report at this time but if you do, a new window will open asking to enter a _File Name_. The _File
Name_ is the name of the file that lives on the BIRT server. It is best practice to use the same name as the RDO.

If you do not save the report now, you can do so later. You should see a screen that looks like the one below with
nothing in the left sidebar. **This is normal**.

To get the left sidebar to populate, click anywhere in the center of the bordered box. Once you click in the box, you
will see two folders appear in the left sidebar. One will be called _Data Objects/YourRDOName_ and the other will be the
_Data Objects/Hyperfind_DO_ that you saw when adding the RDO to the report earlier.

## Adding Columns to Report

To begin adding columns to the report design, expand the _BaseDataSet_ for your RDO. Inside will be the columns that
were added to it. They will appear by their Labels that were set. To add a column to the report, drag it from the left
sidebar to the report canvas. Multiple columns can be selected at once in the order you'd like them to appear in the
report by first clicking the first column and then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>LMB</kbd> Once you have added all of the
columns you want to use, click the <Save className="icon" /> **Save** button. If you did not save after adding the
Report Data Object, you will be prompted to enter a _File Name_. Enter a name and click **OK**. You do not need to
change anything else in this dialog.

:::info

If you are having trouble getting the table to generate, try dragging the column(s) into the bordered text box at the
top of the canvas, under the header

## Publishing a Report

That's it! You've created your first (and possibly very basic) report. Now you need to publish it so that it can be used
in the application. To do this, open the <Menu className="icon"/> menu and navigate to **Application Setup > Common
Setup > Unpublished Reports**. This will open the Unpublished Reports page. Once on this page, select the report you
want to publish and click the <Share2  className="icon" /> **Publish** button. This directs you to the **Unpublished
Reports - Create Published Report** page.

On this page, the following fields are available (items marked with an asterisk are required):

-   **Report Name \*** - This is the name of the report that will appear in the application. It is best practice to use
    the same name as the RDO.
-   **Report Description** - This is the description of the report that will appear in the application. Optional.
-   **Default Output Type \*** - This is the default output type of the report. The options are _PDF_, _Excel_,
    _Interactive_, and _CSV_.
-   **Output Formats \*** - This is the output formats that will be available for the report. The options are _PDF_,
    _Excel_, _Interactive_, and _CSV_. Multiple options can be selected.
-   **Currency Display As** - This is the symbol that will be used for any currency/wage fields in the report. Options
    are _Logged-in User_ and _Employee Assigned_. Optional.
-   **Category** - This is the category that the report will appear under in the application. Optional.
-   **Report Parameters** - This is the table that includes all of the report parameters for the report. In a Custom
    report with no custom parameters, the items listed will be
    -   _TimeFrame_ - Provides the Timeframe dropdown when running the report.
    -   _HyperFindSelector_ - Provides the Hyperfind dropdown when running the report.
    -   _ShowChart_ - Provides the "Show Chart" radio buttons when running the report. This is the only one that should
        be updated by changing the _Display_ from true to false.

:::warning

Setting the _TimeFrame_ and _HyperFindSelector_ parameters to _Display_ = false will hide these parameters when running
the report and the default values of these are Today and All Home. Setting these parameters to _Required_ = false will
cause the report to fail. These parameters are required for the report to run.

:::

Once you are OK with all of the settings, click the **Save** button. This will publish the report and redirect you to
the **Published Reports** page.

Congratulations on publishing your first custom report!

## Testing Your Report

The last step of any good process is to test our work. To test the report you just created, navigate from the home page
to the **Report Library** by clicking the <Menu className="icon" /> menu and selecting **Dataviews & Reports > Report
Library**. This will open the **Report Library** page. Once on this page, click the **Run Report** button.

This will slide open a drawer from the right side of the screen called **Select Report**. Expand the category that you
published the report under and select the report you want to run by clicking it then clicking the **Select** button at
the bottom of the drawer. Once you have the desired parameters (a good test is usually Today for All Home, depending on
how large your All Home is), click the **Run Report** button. This will start the report process. While the report is
running, it will show up as a tile under the **In Progress** section of the **Report Library** page. Once the report is
done running, it will move to the **Completed** section of the **Report Library** page. Clicking the tile will prompt
you to download the report file if it was anything other than _Interactive_.
