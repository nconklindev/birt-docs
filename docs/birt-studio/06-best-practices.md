# Best Practices

These are a list of best practices that have been developed by report SMEs within Support and will help when building
custom reports.

:::info

None of these are a must, and should not be taken as absolute, but not following some of these have been known to cause
issues with reports or add to report development time due to confusion, unclear namings or other reason.

## Naming Conventions

When naming your report, it is best to follow a standard naming convention. Typically we recommend naming reports in
**PascalCase** or **camelCase**. This will help you and others understand what the report is for and what it does. Here
are some examples of what would be considered good naming conventions:

-   EmployeeHoursByJob
-   EmployeeHoursByJobAndDate
-   PunchDetailReport
-   TimecardAudit
-   EmployeeActivityHours

## Each Report Data Object Has a Purpose

A Report Data Object (RDO) should be used in at most one report and only one report. The idea is that an RDO should
contain _only_ the exact number of columns that a single report needs. This helps prevent any future issues or conflicts
that may come up if the RDO was to be used in multiple reports. This also helps keep runtimes down in reports that do
not make use of all of the columns. This is because even when a column is added into an RDO but not used in the report
design, the data is still requested when the report is run, which can increase the runtime of the report.

:::note

This rule can be broken in cases where multiple reports make use of all (or most) of the columns in the RDO, but we
don't suggest using the RDO in reports where this is not the case.

:::

## Think of the Employees!

When creating an Employee based RDO, it is best practice to add _at least_ one column from the **Employee Details**
entity first. This will set the relationship rules so that only those entities that relate to **Employee Details** can
be added. This keeps the RDO conforming to column relationship rules and ensures your report will not have any issues
due to the configuration of the RDO.

## Leave Column Relationship Rules On

When building an RDO or Dataview, the Column Relationship Rules checkbox is enabled by default and the control is hidden
behind a Feature Switch. The Feature Switch is called "Ability to disable column relationship rules". Enabling this
setting will make the checkbox visible again. While this Feature Switch can be enabled to show the checkbox again, we
**do not recommend disabling column relationship rules**.

:::danger

By disabling column relationship rules, you are opening your RDO/Dataview up for potential issues. When unrelated
entities are used together in an RDO, the report may display unexpected behaviors. Some indications that unrelated
entities are being used are:

-   Duplicate rows with seemingly the same data
-   Blank rows
-   "Duplicate" rows where one row shows data in some columns and not others and the subsequent rows showing data in the
    other columns
-   No data
-   Errors

If a Support case is entered and the issue is with a report or Dataview that has Column Relationship Rules disabled,
Support will not be able to assist until a new RDO or Dataview is created with Column Relationship Rules enabled.

## Each Report Has a Purpose

Just like [above](#each-report-data-object-has-a-purpose), each report should have a purpose too. It is easy to get
carried away with creating dozens of computed columns, aggregating unnecessarily, applying too much formatting, etc. and
before you know it, BIRT can no longer load your report, it loads much slower, it starts to fail, or things stop working
while editing. These are all symptoms and indications that a report might be trying to do _too_ much.

The best recommendation is to start with a single idea and a single desired goal of what the report should tell an
end-user. Here are some tips to help you focus your ideas:

**Be as specific as possible** <br/> Want to create a report of Paycode totals? Great! Which ones? Do the Paycodes have
something in common that would help you further identify your goal (e.g. are they all Overtime Paycodes, are they all
related to Exceptions, Leave or Absences)? Being specific in your goal and desired output will help prevent scope creep
and any potential issues down the road.

**Computed columns for the sake of computed columns** <br /> Don't create computed columns just for the sake of computed
columns. If a computed column is made, don't _not_ use it somewhere in your report. Remember, every computed column adds
to what needs to be loaded when editing a report design and running a report.

:::info

Most computed column expressions are "free" in that they shouldn't cause too much overhead. The issue starts when one
computed column is trying to do too much or there are too many computed columns all doing the same thing (such as
computing out hours for a Paycode and returning those hours in a column instead of a row).

:::

**Follow these best practices** <br /> The best practices presented here and in our articles on this site are meant to
guide you to creating the best report possible with zero issues in the final report.

If you feel your report is following these suggestions and you are still having issues with your report failing to open,
failing to run, or returning errors, please open a case with Support.

:::warning

Troubleshooting issues where these best practices are not followed are difficult and a first step may be to go back and
rework the RDO or design.
