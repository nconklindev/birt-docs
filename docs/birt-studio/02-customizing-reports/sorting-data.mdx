## About Sorting Data

The data in a report can be sorted by any column and even multiple columns (up to 3). Read through this article for how to apply sorting to your report.

## Sorting on a Single Column

To sort on a single ungrouped column, select the column and either right click and select _Sort > Sort Ascending_ or _Sort Descending_ or hover over the <MoveVertical className="icon"/> sort icon in the column header and select either _Sort Ascending_ or _Sort Descending_.

:::info

If there are no groups, only one column can be sorted at a time. See [Grouping Data](/docs/birt-studio/customizing-reports/grouping-data) for more information on how to create groups.

## Sorting on Multiple Columns

A lot of times, you will want to sort on multiple columns. To sort on multiple columns, you need to either:

- Have a single or multiple grouped columns and and at least one ungrouped column and apply the sort using the method described in [Sorting on a Single Column](#sorting-on-a-single-column)
- Apply an Advanced Sort

Grouped columns are treated separately from ungrouped columns. This means that if you have a grouped column and an ungrouped column, you can sort on both of them. If you have multiple grouped columns, you can sort on all of them.

:::info

Multiple grouped columns can be sorted, but they will be sorted in the order that they were grouped. For example, if you have a Paycode Name and Employee Name group, and they appear in that order in the report, the sort applied to the Paycode Name takes precedence.

:::

### Advanced Sort

An Advanced Sort allows you to sort on multiple columns, even if you have no grouped columns. To apply an Advanced Sort, right click on a column and select _Sort > Advanced Sort_. This will open the Advanced Sort dialog.

:::info

The Advanced Sort dialog dropdown options will only show columns that are not grouped. If you have a grouped column, you will need to remove the grouping to sort on that column.

:::

Start by selecting a _Sort By_ column and either _Ascending_ or _Descending_ order. To add multiple sorts, select one or more _Then By_ sorts.
