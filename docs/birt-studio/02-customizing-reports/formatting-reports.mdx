## Editing Column Labels

To edit a column label, quickly double click on the column header label. This will put a dark blue box around the label
indicating that it is selected. Right click and select _Edit Text_ to edit the column label.

:::info

For CSV Reports, editing the column header label does not affect the underlying data binding. It is only a visual
change. For more information on creating CSV reports, see the
[Creating CSV Reports](/docs/birt-studio/advanced/creating-csv-reports) article.

## Formatting Data

There are a wide variety of formatting options available for custom reports. To access the formatting options for a
given column, right click on the column header and select _Format > Format Data_. This will open the _Format Data_
dialog. To determine the type of data fields that are in your report, right click on any column and select the _Data
Fields_ option. The _Field Name_ column will be the column key name and the _Type_ column will indicate the type of data
that is in the column. If the type says "string", then it is considered "text" for the purposes of this article.

Formatting any of the available types is done in the same way. The _Format Data_ dialog will look different depending on
the type of data that is being formatted. The following sections will go over the different types of data that can be
formatted.

Each type provides a "Custom" option that provides a text box where a custom format can be entered. When selecting the
Custom option, examples will be proivded of allowed characters.

### Formatting Numbers

To format a number, select the column that contains the data you want to format, such as **Actual Hours** from the
**Timecard Transactions** Entity. Open the Format Data dialog following the steps in
[Formatting Data](#formatting-data). The dialog that opens may look like this:

The options for formatting numbers are:

-   Unformatted
-   General Number
-   Currency
-   Fixed (default for most)
-   Percent
-   Scientific
-   Custom

The Unformatted and General Number formats drop any trailing zeros after the decimal point. Fixed format will be the
default for most numbers that are coming out of Pro WFM and will display two decimal places by default. This number can
be increased by changing the _Decimal Places_ value from the dropdown. The max is 10. The other options can be changed
according to personal preference.

### Formatting Dates

The options for formatting dates are:

-   mmm dd, yyyy (e.g. Jan 1, 2023)
-   MMM dd, yyyy (e.g. January 1, 2023)
-   mm/dd/yyyy (e.g. 01/01/2023)
-   Custom

### Formatting Date and Time

The options for formatting date and time are:

-   Unformatted (default)
-   MMM dd, yyyy
-   mm dd, yyyy
-   mm/dd/yyyy
-   hh:mm:ss a Z (e.g. 12:00:00 PM UTC)
-   hh:mm:ss a (e.g. 12:00:00 PM)
-   HH:mm (e.g. 16:30)

The Unformatted option will be selected by default but it will not show as an option. The top option would be considered
the "Unformatted" option since it is the same as the default.

:::info

Dates and Times are unaffected by the Locale Policy of the user running the report
<strong class="not-prose">and</strong> the Tenant Default. They will always display in American English format. Use the
Custom option to format dates and times to another locale. Any format is applied for _all_ users running the report and
are not individual.

:::

### Formatting Time

The time options are the same as the last 3 options for [Formatting Date and Time](#formatting-date-and-time).

### Formatting Text

The options for formatting text are:

-   Unformatted
-   Uppercase
-   Lowercase
-   Custom

### Formatting Currency

Formatting Currency is the same as [Formatting Numbers](#formatting-numbers). Select the _Currency_ option from the
dropdown when formatting a number. The available options to format the currency are:

-   Symbol
-   Symbol Position
-   Decimal Places
-   Use 1000s Separator
-   Negative Numbers

Change these options according to personal preference.

### Formatting Booleans

Formatting a boolean only allows you to change the display text for the boolean value.

## Conditional Formatting

BIRT Studio allows you to format columns based on a specified condition. To open the **Conditional Formatting** window,
right click on the column you want to apply conditional formatting to and select _Format > Conditional Formatting_. This
will open the **Conditional Formatting** window. Your window may look different depending on the type of data you are
formatting.

The top is a preview of the selected format. Click the _Format_ link to open the formatting options. These are straight
forward and can change things such as the Font, Font Size, Color, Background Color, and more.

In the next row, the first field determines when conditional formatting takes effect. It does not need to be the same
one as the one selected. The second field is the condition such as Equal To, Between, Greater Than, etc. These are all
explained in [Applying Filters](/docs/birt-studio/customizing-reports/filtering#filter-conditions). Lastly, the text
field is the value that must be met by the condition for the format to apply. For example, using the above screenshot as
an example, if you want to format all values that are greater than 4, you would select the _Greater Than_ condition and
enter 4 in the text field.

:::warning

The column that is selected is the column that the formatting is being applied _to_. Make sure that the column you want
to format is the correct one listed next to the _Selected Column_ label.

:::

## Changing Font Properties

The font of the data in a column can be changed by right clicking on the column header and selecting _Format > Font_.
This will open the **Font** dialog. The options are straight forward and can be changed according to personal
preference.

## Changing the Alignment of Text

The alignment of text in a column can be changed by right clicking on the column header and selecting _Alignment_. This
will open the **Alignment** dialog. Choose one of the alignment options: Align Left, Align Center, or Align Right. Click
**OK** to save the changes.

## Changing the Order of Columns

To change the order of columns, select a column by clicking on anywhere inside the column. Make sure the column is
selected, indicated by a dark blue border around the column. Left click and hold and drag the column to the desired
location in the report design. A blue line will appear indicating where the column will be placed when the mouse button
is released.

Alternatively, the entire table can be selected by selecting a column and then clicking the table handle above the
column headers. Click the <Pencil className="icon" /> **Edit** icon to open the **Table Builder** window. The columns
can be rearranged by selecting a column on the right side under _Current Column Selections_ and clicking the up or down
arrows to move the column up or down in the list. Click **OK** to save the changes.

The last option to change the order of the columns in the report is to preview the report in preview mode, and drag the
column(s) to the desired location. You will need to save the report after making the changes.

:::warning

If there are computed columns in the report design, they will not appear in this list.

:::

:::danger

As of 09.08.00 (2024.R1), the drag and drop functionality in reports is not working as expected. The column will not be
placed where the blue line is indicating. The only way to change the order of the columns are the ways above.

## Merging Data into One Column

You can merge the data from two or more columns into one column. When you merge data, the data appears on multiple
lines. It also enables you to include more columns without exceeding the width of the page. This is ideal for some types
of data but might not be ideal for others. Be sure to try it out in your own report to see if it works for you.

To merge data from a column, select all the columns that contain data to merge. Press
<kbd class="kbd text-neutral-content">Ctrl</kbd> and click each column header to select multiple columns. Right click on
any of the selected columns and select _Column > Merge Columns_. This will merge the data from the selected columns into
one column.

### How To Merge Column Headers

To merge the column headers, select the column header in the bottom row of the merged column by double clicking in the
column header cell. This will put a border around the header label to indicate that it has been selected. Right click
the selected column header and select _Cell > Merge Up_. This will merge the column header with the column header above
it. Repeat this process until one column header remains.

## Adding a New Column Header Row

If you need to add more text or space in the header area, you can add multiple column header rows. When you insert a new
column header row, the row is added above the selected row and spans the entire width of the table. Formatting and
borders are copied from the row below and can be changed later.

### How To Add a New Column Header Row

To add a new column header row, double click inside the column header area. This will place a border around the column
label to indicate the header is selected. Right click and select _Cell > Insert Row Above_ to insert a new column header
row. Choose _Insert Row Below_ to insert a new column header row below the selected row.

### How To Merge Column Headers to Type Text that Spans Multiple Columns

Double click on the column header row that you want to merge. This will place a border around the column header row to
indicate the row is selected. Right click and select _Cell > Merge Right_ to merge the selected column header to the
right. Repeat this process across the entire row to merge all the columns in the row.

## Changing Column Width

The column width of any column can be changed by selecting the column, moving the mouse over the right side of the
column header until the cursor changes to the resize cursor and then clicking and dragging the column to the desired
width.

:::info

Resizing column width does not appear to function as it does in other programs such as Excel where you can drag the
column to an infinite width. Depending on the number of column in the table, there appears to be a maximum width that a
column can be resized to. Resizing one column may shrink the others around it. If there are so many columns in a report
that a single column needs to be resized, it may be best to consider changing the page orientation to landscape or
setting the Page Layout to Auto Expand Width. See the [Changing the Page Layout](#changing-page-layout) section for more
information.

:::

## Changing Page Layout

Sometimes it is helpful to change the page layout if the report design contains many columns and the columns in the
design are so squished that it is hard to read the column header label or the data itself.

To change the page layout, click the menu bar at the top and select _File > Page Setup..._ . From here, you can change
the Orientation from "Auto" to "Landscape" and the Page Layout from "Fixed" to "Auto Expand Width". Click **OK** to save
the changes.

The _Master Page_ can also be changed to use a different paper size in the _Size_ dropdown. The options are A4, US
Legal, US Letter, and Custom which allows you to enter a custom paper size.

Margins of the report can be adjusted under the _Margin_ label.

## Changing the Report Title

To change the report title, double click the default **Report Title** text at the top of the report in the report
header. This will place a cursor inside a text box to edit the report title. Click outside the text box to save the
changes.
