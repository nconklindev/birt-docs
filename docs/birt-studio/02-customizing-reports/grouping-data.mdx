## Benefits of Grouping Data

Sorting data is only one way to organize data in a report. But, in report development, it is common to present data that
is organized into meaningful groups, especially reports with a large number of columns. With groups, you can:

-   Add [Aggregations](./aggregating) to summarize data within each group.
-   Insert page breaks before or after each group to start each group of data on a new page.
-   Hide the details of each group to view a summary report
    [Creating Summary Tables](/docs/birt-studio/advanced/creating-summary-tables).

Upon creating a group, BIRT Studio performs the following:

-   Removes duplicate values
-   Sorts the values of each group (though this can be changed - [Sorting Data](./sorting-data))

## How to Create a Group

Creating groups is very easy to do in BIRT Studio. To create a group, select a column and click the group icon in the
table toolbar. This will create a group with the selected column as the group key. You can also right-click on a column
and select **Group > Add Group** from the context menu. Multiple groups can be created by performing the same steps on
other columns.

To remove a group, select the column and click the "Delete Group" icon (it will look like and be in the same position on
the table toolbar as the "Add Group" icon but will have an "X" in the bottom right corner of the icon). You can also
right-click on the group header and select **Group > Delete Group** from the context menu.

:::warning

The first two groups created will have a light grey background color applied to the entire group row. After the second
group, this formatting stops being applied and the group row is harder to distinguish from the other data rows. This is
normal and cannot be changed. It's generally recommended to try to keep the number of groups at two or use formatting
for anything beyond two.

### Grouping on Date and Time Columns

When grouping on date and time columns, BIRT Studio will present two options:

-   Group using individual values
-   Group every X time units

Grouping using individual values will group the data by the individual values in the column. For example, if you have a
datetime column that has the value Dec 22, 2023 7:30 AM, then the group will be Dec 22, 2023 7:30 AM. This is not
usually the most useful and you will more often than not want to group using the second option.

Grouping every X time units will group the data by the time unit you select. For example, using the same values as
above, then the group will be Dec 22, 2023. This is much more useful in most cases.

The values that are available for the time units are:

-   Years
-   Quarters
-   Months
-   Weeks
-   Days
-   Hours
-   Minutes
-   Seconds

## Changing the Order of Groups

Groups can be reordered by right clicking on a grouped column and selecting **Column > Reorder Columns**. Groups can be
reordered by clicking the up and down arrows in the _Grouped Columns_ section.

:::info

This window also allows you to reorder the columns in the table. This is useful if you want to change the order of the
columns in the table but don't want to delete and re-add the columns. Reordering columns is also discussed in
[Sorting Data](./sorting-data).

## Creating Sections

A section is functionally equivalent to a group. When you create a section, you are also grouping data. Similar to
groups, you can create multiple sections, calculate aggregate data for each section, start each section on a new page,
and hide the details of each section.

However, one of the differences between a section and a group is how the information is arranged. See the below images
for an example of a group and a section.

:::info

For other examples of how sections can be used, review some of the existing Timekeeping reports in the Report Library
such as the **Time Detail** report and the **Condensed Employee Time Detail** report. Other reports in the Report
Library also use sections but these are good examples of the types of data that work well with sections since these two
reports were created by UKG.

:::

To create a section in an existing report, select the columns that you want to be added as a section by left clicking on
the first column and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> clicking on any other column. Right click and select _Group > Add Section_. This
will add the columns as sections.

:::info

For most report designs built using BIRT Studio, sections are not typically needed. You can create very nice and simple
reports without sections and using groups instead.

:::

## Hiding Details

Hiding details is useful to create things like [summary tables](/docs/birt-studio/advanced/creating-summary-tables).

:::info

Hiding details requires at least one group be present before it is visible.

:::

To hide details in a design that has a group applied, select the grouped column, then right click to open the column
context menu. Select **Group > Hide Detail**. Once that is selected, anything that is not in the grouped header row will
be hidden.

### Unhiding/Show Details

To unhide the previously hidden details rows, select the grouped column again, right click to open the context menu, and
select **Group > Show Detail**.

If there are multiple groupings applied, then the details must be shown from the deepest group first.
