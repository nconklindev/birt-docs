## CSV Format

Reports in BIRT Studio can be updated to run in CSV format. CSV stands for "Comma separated values" and is a text file
format that uses commas to separate values. Configuring a report to run in CSV format is useful if the data inside the
report needs to be exported to another system or application and they require the data to be in CSV format. Getting a
BIRT Studio report to run in CSV Format is a simple process that just requires a few steps in and out of the report.

:::warning

A report run in CSV format will only return the **raw** data from the report. This means that formatted data and
modified column headers will return as they do from the database. For example, you format a date in your report from
January 1, 2024 to 1/1/2024. When the report is run in CSV format, the date will return however it is returned from the
database, in this case, January 1, 2024. This is just an example and may not be how dates are returned.

## Configuring the Report Design

### Setting the Table Name

The first thing that needs to be done to setup the report design for CSV format, is to set a table name on the table
that is going to be exported. Select the entire table by selecting a single column then clicking the table bar above the
column headers. The entire table will be selected when a blue border is around the entire table. Click the
<Settings className="icon" /> **Properties** icon to open the Table Properties. A drawer will open on the right side.
Fill in the top text box labeled **Table Name**. Click **OK** when done.

:::warning

If a report design contains multiple tables, only one can be used in the CSV format.

### Setting the CSV_EXPORT_TABLE_NAME Parameter

After the table is set, the next step is to set the CSV_EXPORT_TABLE_NAME parameter. To do this, click on **Data >
Manage Parameters** and click the <Pencil className="icon" /> **Edit** icon next to the CSV_EXPORT_TABLE_NAME parameter.
A window will appear in the middle of the screen. In the **Default Value** text box, enter the table name that was set
in the previous step. Click **OK** when done.

### Setting the CSV_EXPORT_COLUMN_NAMES_ORDER Parameter

To set the _CSV_EXPORT_COLUMN_NAMES_ORDER_ parameter, you should take note of the column _binding_ names that are set in
the Report Data Object. These are whatever value is in the _Label_ field for each column. The steps for this will assume
all default label names. Click on **Data > Manage Parameters** and click the <Pencil className="icon" /> **Edit** icon
next to the CSV_EXPORT_COLUMN_NAMES_ORDER parameter. A window will appear in the middle of the screen. In the **Default
Value** text box, enter the names of the column bindings in the order you'd like them to appear in the CSV report,
separated by a semicolon. An example output may look like:

<code>
    Employee Full Name;Employee ID;Actual Total Hours (Include Corrections);Actual Total Apply Date;Paycode Name
</code>

This is just an example but your parameter should be formatted similarly when complete.

:::info

Computed columns can be used in the parameter as well, but make sure that you use the computed column's binding name and
not the label name.

:::

When you are done editing the **Default Value**, click **OK**. After setting the two parameters described in the two
previous steps, the report design is done and if the report is unpublished, it can be published following the steps from
the [Publishing a Report](/docs/birt-studio/getting-started#publishing-a-report) section.

:::danger

Do not edit the "Required" checkbox for either of the CSV parameters. This will cause the report to fail when run. It is
disabled by default and should not be enabled.

:::

## Configuring the Report Options

### Setting the Available Formats

On the Report Options page (after clicking "Edit" on the Published Report), select CSV from the **Output formats**. This
will check off the format and make it available when run. If this is all you wanted to do and you do not want to change
the default format, you can click **Save** and the report will be ready to run in CSV format.

### (Optional) Setting the Default Format

To set the default format as CSV, select it from the **Default Output Type** dropdown. Click **Save** to save your
changes.
