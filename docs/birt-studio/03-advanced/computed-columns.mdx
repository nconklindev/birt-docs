## What are Computed Columns?

Computed Columns in BIRT Studio are columns that are created using the custom functions provided in BIRT Studio. The [functions](#birt-studio-functions) in BIRT Studio are somewhat similar to function calls in a modern programming language such as Python or Javascript where it is written as <code>functionName(arg1, arg2, etc.)</code>. The function is written independently in a text box that is called on

## Creating a Computed Column

To create a computed column in BIRT Studio, right click on a column header and select **Column > New Computed Column**. This will open the _New Computed Column_ window.

In the _Column Label_ field, enter a label for the column. This will be the name that appears in the column header. There is a _Category_ dropdown that will allow you to browse the existing function categories mentioned below. Changing this dropdown changes the functions available in the _Select Function_ area.

To enter a custom expression, select "Advanced..." in any category. This shows a previously hidden _Enter Expression_ text area. Enter your custom expression here. Click the _Validate_ button to check if the expression is valid. If it is valid, a dialog stating "The expression is valid" will appear. If it is invalid, BIRT Studio will alert you. Click **OK** to close the dialog. Click **Cancel** to close the _New Computed Column_ window without saving. Click **OK** in the _New Computed Column_ window to save the computed column.

:::info

If you are creating a computed column that is only being used in another computed column, a good practice is to set the label in camelCase so that it is easy to identify it from other computed columns and is a reminder that it is not being used in the final report.

:::warning

Column labels cannot be changed once the computed column has been saved. Make sure you are happy with the label before saving!
