## Personalizing a Dataview

All Dataviews can be configured by every individual user and that configuration is then saved to display the Dataview how that user has set it up.

To personalize a Dataview, a Dataview must actively be loaded from the Dataview Library. To navigate to the Dataview Library, navigate to the **Home Menu > Dataviews & Reports > Dataview Library**. From the **Dataview Library**, select the Dataview that you wish to personalize.

Once the Dataview is loaded, you will see everything displayed based on how it is configured by default from **Dataview Management**. After making any any of the changes below, click **Save** and the changes you've made will now only appear for you.

### Timeframe

The timeframe can be set to something other than what is configured by choosing a new period from the <Calendar className="icon" /> Timeframe dropdown.

### Hyperfind

The Hyperfind can be changed from its default by selecting any of the available options from the Hyperfind dropdown.

### Columns

Columns can be changed in the same way they can be customized when making a Dataview. This means that any column can be hidden, grouped, filtered, sorted and have a calculation added to it. To sort, hide, group and apply a calculation to a column, click the <ChevronDown className="icon" /> down arrow in the column to have the available options shown.

To apply a filter to any column, click the <Filter className="icon" /> filter icon and select "Show Filters Row". This will add two additional rows beneath each column header. The top dropdown will be the condition to be applied and the second row will be an input field for the value. Conditions can be found in [this](/docs/birt-studio/customizing-reports/filtering#filter-conditions) article.

## Not Seeing Something?

If you are not seeing something that should be in the Dataview according to the creator of the Dataview, if your <RotateCcw className="icon" /> Restore icon is highlighted (color will change based on branding), click it to restore the Dataview to its default configuration.
