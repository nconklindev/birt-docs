# Getting Started

:::warning

Before getting started with creating Dataviews, it is highly recommended that you at least review the [Getting Started](/docs/data-dictionary/getting-started) article on the Data Dictionary. It's a quick read and covers important topics like column relationship rules and things to note during column selection. There will be many terms that are referenced there that will not make sense if you are just getting started with reporting/Dataviews in Pro WFM.
