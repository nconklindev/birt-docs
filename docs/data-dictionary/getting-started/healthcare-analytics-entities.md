Healthcare Analytics provides metrics and key performance indicators that measure productivity performance for all areas of the healthcare organization for acute care.

Managers can compare the hours and amounts worked against a target and they can perform variance analysis. Managers can do this analysis for daily activity based on timekeeping data, or can do pay period analysis based on payroll activity. In addition to reporting daily and pay period activity, you can return results for the last six pay periods or the year-to-date (YTD) pay period. These options allow analysis of historical trends. Finally, managers can evaluate the metrics and key performance indicators for full-time and part-time staff, as well as for supplemental types of labor (Overtime, Float, Agency, Internal Agency, Pool, Per Diem) all of which allows the managers to see and understand the labor distribution.

Healthcare Analytics gives you the power to measure and manage productivity — daily and by pay period — by analysis of transactions from a facility’s billing (volume), payroll, and timekeeping data.

Healthcare Analytics delivers a set of metrics that measure how well the labor hours match work volume. The metric for matching labor to volume is productivity, which is calculated from the actual worked hours and the number of hours that should have been worked, as shown by the actual work volume. Managers can ensure that the labor hours are cost-effective by tracking discretionary labor hours by type (overtime, agency) against budget. If variances occur, the analysis helps managers pinpoint the reasons for the variances so that they can take action to remedy the variance.
